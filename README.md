tinychad be a deep learning framework, not a good deep learning framework

it is gonna be slow, but its gonna be based

goals: 
  - write a compiler that compiles tinychad code into assmebly OR into something more based
  - recreate important deep learning architectures using tinychad (LSTM, RESNET, Transformer)

TODO: 
  - broadcasting rules for going backwards on unary ops (SUM, RESHAPE, MAX)
