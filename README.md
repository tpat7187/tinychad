tinychad be a deep learning framework, not a good deep learning framework

it is gonna be slow, but its gonna be based

goals: 
  - write a compiler that compiles tinychad code into assmebly OR into something more based
  - recreate important deep learning architectures using tinychad (LSTM, RESNET, Transformer)

TODO: 
  - write actual unit tests for all forward and backward ops
  - computation graph
  - how does SUM, RESHAPE, MAX work for ndarrays?
  - MNIST (write an optimizer)


things to read:
